## Math 538 (Bayesian Statistics)

### Course Description
In this course, we discuss the philosophy and extensively cover modeling methods from the Bayesian perspective. The object of the course is to prvide students with a solid understanding of Baysian theory as well as computational tools needed to implement a variety of Bayesian model types. Some of the topics covered are: Conjugate, Non-informative, and Improper Priors; Posterior point and interval estimates; Predictive Inference; MCMC, Gibbs Sampling, and Metropolis-Hastings algorithms; Hierarchical modeling; Regression analysis; Variable Selection; Model Comparison.
