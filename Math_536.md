## Math 534 (Generalized Linear Models and Catagorical Data Analysis)

### Course Description
The course begins by developing the foundations of linear regression and then attention is drawn to the principles of bootstrapping and generalized
linear models. The course then introduces modern classification models in the discipline of categorical or discrete data analysis. 

### Major topics descussed 
- Confidence intervals using classical theoretical properties and bootstrapping simulation
- A practical approch to hypothesis testing
- Regression (Simple, Multiple, Logistic)
- Non-parameteric techniques for ordinal data
- Analysis of Variance
- Generalized Linear Models
- Classification Trees, Random Forests, Adaptive Boosting

### Textbook Used
Two texts are used:
- The first is A Modern Approach to Regression by Sheather.
- The Second is Categorical Data Analysis by Agresti, Third Edition.
