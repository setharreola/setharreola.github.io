## Math 533 (Machine/Statistical Learning)

### Course Description
The main objective of the course is to become familiarized with the recent developments in statistical sciences, particulary the emergence of computationally oriented methods of statistical learning (also known as machine learning). This course allows for the discussion of the theoreticial and computational aspects of a host of modern statistical techniques, currently implemented for the analysis of high dimensional data. Specifically, the course aims to cover relevent topics such as supervised and unsupervised learning methods for classification and prediction, shrinkage, corss-validation for model assessment and prediction, natrual language processing, and neural networks.
