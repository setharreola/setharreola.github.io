## A Few Strategies for the Statistical Modeling of the COVID-19 Pandamic

**Project description:** In this project a series of robust statistical models were applied to COVID-19 data in order to model the transmition of the virus, along with gaining insight into the nature of transmition effectiveness among differeing counties with respect to mobility data. Mobility data included Apple and Google mobility/transit data (i.e. Apple and Google Maps), which was used as inital input features for the predictive models. Some supervised learning models utilized include Neural Networks, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors. Moreover a class of models known as Generialized Linear Auto-Regressive Moving-Average (GLARMA) was also applied to build a pridictive engine for the same purpose. Some of the models attained more than 90$ accuracy and revealed that the rate of the spread can be significantly slowwer in more prosperous counties.
